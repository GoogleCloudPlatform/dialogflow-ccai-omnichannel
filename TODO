* When you're not logged in, and you log in for the first time. 
Sometimes you run into a websockets error, because the websocket is not open.
Probably because it was closed, when no login was ready

- If I refresh, and ask "call me" - then somehow the uid isnt set

              // hello display-name
                // we couldn't retrieve your g-mortgage account
                // please use the same phone number as registered on the website
            // GOOGLE ASSISTANT - on load fetch the google assistant data, the email must match
